"""ERRANT scoring for `ask_gec_nob`, run inside lm-evaluation-harness.

ERRANT is corpus-level: the pooled source/target and source/prediction pairs
are aligned into M2 files and compared in a single pass, cached on the item
content so the pass runs once per evaluation.  `errant_f05_stderr` carries the
standard error: per-sentence TP/FP/FN counts are recovered from the M2 files,
verified against `errant_compare`'s corpus score, and bootstrapped over
documents.

Predictions are normalised with `.replace("\n\n", "\n")` and nothing else,
matching `errant.py` in this directory: an empty prediction stays empty and is
scored as deleting the sentence.
