"""Shared scoring for the NorEval multiple-choice tasks.

A custom process_results replaces lm-eval's built-in multiple_choice scoring
entirely, so the accuracies are re-implemented here with the harness's
formulas, alongside their continuous counterparts.  Each task's yaml points
doc_to_choice at the same function it passes to `make_process_results`, so the
strings the harness scores are the strings normalized here.

Scores come in three variants: raw loglikelihoods (""), per-character
loglikelihoods ("_norm"; a ranking no-op when all choices have equal length),
and PMI ("_mutual_info"; conditional minus unconditional loglikelihoods,
identically zero in zero-shot runs of tasks with an empty prompt).  Each
variant yields:
  * "acc*":          1 if the argmax is a correct choice,
  * "prob_correct*": softmax mass on the correct choice(s) -- for "_norm"
                     this is a temperature-scaled distribution (temperature
                     ~ choice length), not a calibrated probability, and
  * "loglikelihood_correct*": the best correct choice's score, passed through.
